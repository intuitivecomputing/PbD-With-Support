# PbD-With-Support
This repository contains the source code for an end-user robot programming system that can be used for programming a robot manipulator by kinesthetic demonstration; the system includes a customizable help menu and chat assistant to support end-users during programming. The system consists of a front-end web interface and back-end software that runs on Ubuntu 20.04 using [ROS](https://www.ros.org/) Noetic.

## Software and Hardware Requirements for Running the Programming System

### Front-End
The  front-end code has been deployed on a system running Ubuntu 20.04 (64-bit). The software was hosted using an [Apache](https://httpd.apache.org/download.cgi) server (version 2.4.41) and was run on [Mozilla Firefox for Ubuntu](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/linux/) Version 117.0 (64-bit).
